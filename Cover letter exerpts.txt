Billing system Radio-Canada CBC:
During my time at radio-canada, I was in charge of deliverying a billing and payment system to handle 
the payment and purchase of distribution rights for different broadcasts of media. Because of the complicated
nature of distribution contracts, I had to implement a lot of complex and evolving business requirements into 
the system as a lot of stakeholders joined the projects.

Subscription system at doormonster:
While making the doormonster platform from scratch, I implement a Subscription service from scratch for priviledged members with
recurring billing using stripe.

Building a lot of Angular applications from scratch with a c# backend:
During my time at Radio-Canada, I built dozens of applications in Angular from scratch ranging from the complexity of simple dashboard to small
social media platforms for journalists to share media they took on the field for different articles and the news that night. 

Accesibility:
I was trained in web accesibility by CBC/Radio-Canada to make sure colorblind, deaf and blind people would be able to use our internal 
tools more easily
